# Motorized-Potentiometer
Move a potentiometer with an Arduino instead of your fingers. 

This project requires modifying potentiometers so that they can be turned by a motor. For a description of how I handled these hardware changes, see this video: https://youtu.be/FC-mKifyZSE

To set up the code, download the zip file and extract it. Move the PID folder into you Arduino/libraries folder.
